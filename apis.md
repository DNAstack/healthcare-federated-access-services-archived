# Endpoints

This file documents the endpoints of IC and DAM.

## IC

### Main Endpoints

The following are the main IC endpoints:

*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/login/{name}": Redirected here from login page and selecting an IdP.
*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/loggedin/{name}": Redirected here from an IdP.
*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/inforelease": Redirected here from claim release consent page.
*  "/identity/login": Redirected to here from Hydra login.
*  "/identity/consent": Redirected to here from Hydra consent.
*  "/identity/loggedin": Redirected to here from Identity Broker.

### Administration Endpoints

The following are administration endpoints for managing DAM.
They require "admin" permission.

*  "/identity": metadata about the service, like versions of various services.

### Configuration Admin Endpoints

The following are used for managing IC's configuration.
They require "admin" permission.

*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/config" and sub-resources: managing configuration.
*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/config/reset": resets the configuration to its initial version read from configuration file.
*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/config/history": history of configuration changes.

### Users, Tokens, and Consents Management Endpoints

The following implement a subset of [SCIM V2 API](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.2).

*  "/identity/scim/v2/{realm}/Users": user management, based on SCIM V2.
*  "/identity/scim/v2/{realm}/Me": based on SCIM V2.

SCIM-like endpoints have the following user management limitations:

*  See "proto/scim/v2/users.proto" for details of the structure that is
   supported.
*  Account management updates require the `account_admin` scope on the access
   token.
*  A limited subset of filters is available.
*  When using filters to patch a specific object in a list, use `$ref` as the
   filter for that object. For example:
      ```
      {
          "op": "replace",
          "path": "emails[$ref eq \"email/persona/non-admin\"].primary",
          "value":"true"
      }
      ```
*  Only a limited number of object fields are available for PATCH. For example,
   `primary` for emails and `value` for photos.

You can link accounts using the following extension to SCIM V2:

1. Account 1: Login to the IC with the both the `account_admin` and `link`
   scopes.
2. Account 2: Login to the IC with another account with `account_admin` and
   `link` scopes.
3. Make a PATCH request to `/identity/scim/v2/{realm}/Me` while providing Account
   1 and Account 2 bearer tokens via the `Authorization` and
   `X-Link-Authorization` headers, and a body that contains a patch operation
   as follows:

       ```
       {
           "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
           "Operations":[
               { "op": "add", "path": "emails", "value": "X-Link-Authorization" }
           ]
       }
       ```

The following is a code sampel of a PATCH request to link accounts given
variables (`serviceURL`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `token1` and `token2`):

```
let patch = `{"schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],"Operations":[{"op":"add","path":"emails","value":"X-Link-Authorization"}]}`;
$.ajax({
    url: `${serviceURL}/identity/scim/v2/master/Me?client_id=${clientId}&client_secret=${clientSecret}`,
    type: "PATCH",
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    dataType: "json",
    data: patch,
    processData: false,
    beforeSend: function(xhr){
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', `Bearer ${token1}`);
        xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Link-Authorization', `Bearer ${token2}`);
    },
    success: function(resp) {
        console.log("LINK ACCOUNT SUCCESS:\n\n" + JSON.stringify(resp, undefined, 2));
    },
    error: function(err, status, info) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(err, undefined, 2) + `,\nstatus: "${status}", info: "${info}"`);
    }
});
```

#### Tokens and Consents

The following token and consents are used:

*  "/tokens": tokens management. For more information, see
   "proto/tokens/v1/consents.proto".
*  "/consents": consent management. For more information, see
   "proto/tokens/v1/tokens.proto".

### Configuration Non-Admin Endpoints

The following provide read-only access to non-admins for various parts of
IC configuration. They filter out sensitive parts of the configuration.

*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/identityProviders"
*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/clients/{name}"
*  "/identity/v1alpha/{realm}/passportTranslators"

### Static Page Assets

The following static page assets are used:

*  "/identity/static"

## DAM

### Main Endpoints

The following are the main DAM endpoints. Users can retrieve access tokens for
resources they want using the following OIDC and DAM token checkout endpoints.

*  "/dam/login": Redirected to here from Hydra login.
*  "/dam/consent": Redirected to here from Hydra consent.
*  "/dam/oidc/loggedin": Redirected to here from Identity Broker.
*  "/dam/checkout": returns the batch of access tokens for the requested
   resources.

**NOTE:** "/dam/oidc/loggedin" will be renamed to "/dam/oidc/accept"

### Administration Endpoints

The following are administration endpoints for managing DAM.
They require "admin" permission.

*  "/dam": metadata about the service, like versions of various services.
*  "/dam/v1alpha/{realm}/processes": the list of background processes.
*  "/dam/v1alpha/{realm}/processes/{name}": the state of a background process.

### Configuration Admin Endpoints

The following are used for managing DAM's configuration.
They require "admin" permission.

*  "/dam/v1alpha/{realm}/config/reset": resets the config to its initial version read from configuration file.
*  "/dam/v1alpha/{realm}/config/history": history of configuration changes.
*  /dam/v1alpha/{realm}/tests": performs a set of tests for validity of the current configuration.

### Configuration Non-Admin Endpoints

The following provide read-only access to non-admins for various parts of
DAM configuration. They filter out sensitive parts of the configuration.

*  /dam/v1alpha/{realm}/client/{name}
*  /dam/v1alpha/{realm}/resources
*  /dam/v1alpha/{realm}/resources/{name}
*  /dam/v1alpha/{realm}/flatViews
*  /dam/v1alpha/{realm}/resources/{name}/views
